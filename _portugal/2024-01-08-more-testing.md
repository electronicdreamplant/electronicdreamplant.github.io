I'm concerned that posts are not automatically being created and be available for viewing, as I've been used to in the past

I wonder if I've tweaked the format too much and that this is causing a failure somewhere

## Checks done

I've made sure that the posts are in the right format, the links are structured correctly and the file is visible in the repository.

## What next?

I don't know!
