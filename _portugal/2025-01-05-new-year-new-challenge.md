description: How we decided to move to Portugal
---

I decided that the New Year was a good time to start charting our move to Portugal. Although we've already talked about it with friends and family, it's still not completely public. Indeed, until it is these posts won't be going live. Just in case.

So come with me now while we take a quick flit back to the origins of a move overseas.

## In the beginning...

It's fair to say my family has a bit of a tradition in not staying put in the UK. My oldest sister emigrated to Australia when she was 18 (without ever having visited there). My other sister had a spell working in Canada as an au-pair before meeting her future husband and deciding to make it her home. And my parents, well into their retirement, decided to make Canada their home too (although that only lasted 2 years).

If that wasn't enough, my wife took European Studies at university, which entailed spending a year living in Germany, my in-laws bought a house in Brittany, my brother-in-law is from Venezuela and my (future) son-in-law is from Jordan.

That itch to switch also infected me a few decades ago. With family overseas I had ambitions to move to Canada or Australia, but beyond writing the odd letter these were unformed plans that never developed into anything solid.

## Project Windmill

The itch didn't go away, and in 2014 after a couple of holidays in the Netherlands we hit upon the plan to move there. This extended at one point to learning Dutch (well, for one of us). The barrier that kept coming up was how we'd make it pay - we could only do that by both finding jobs there.
