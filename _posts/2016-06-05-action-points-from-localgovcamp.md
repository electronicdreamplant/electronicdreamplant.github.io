title: "Learning Points from LocalGovCamp"

June 2016 was the first LocalGovCamp I'd attended. 

After the brain-altering shock of UKGovCamp in January I wasn't sure what to expect. Could it match the excitement and scale? Would I walk away as inspired? Would I meet amazing people

The answers are;
* Not quite the same scale, but plenty of excitement to go around
* Inspiration in buckets (see below) because it felt more relevant to my sector
* Of course! And because I'd had a chance to speak to a few of them before, it was great to meet in person (particularly BooTheBookworm)

These are some of the things I noted as action points for me after the day;

* Try and get HotJar working for our forms. Liverpool are using data to make sound decisions
* Contact Lucy Knight about open data and possible training. There is help available for us in moving forward on OpenGov
* Look at ODI heroku app for dashboard. Time to get playing with code!
* Follow up on address data for polling districts. Democracy Club need people like me
* Home office forms on node.js? It may be time to move away from the idea of a forms engine
* Find out about json scrapers and how to use them. This unlocks the web
