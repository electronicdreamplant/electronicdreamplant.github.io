These are some of the things I noted when I left;

* Try and get HotJar working for forms
* Contact Lucy Knight about open data and possible training
* Look at ODI heroku app for dashboard
* Follow up on address data for polling districts
* Home office forms on node.js?
* Find out about json scrapers and how to use them
