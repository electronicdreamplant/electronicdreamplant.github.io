These are some of the things I noted after the day;

* Try and get HotJar working for forms. Liverpool are using data to make sound decisions
* Contact Lucy Knight about open data and possible training. There is help for us in moving forward on OpenGov
* Look at ODI heroku app for dashboard. Time to get playing with code!
* Follow up on address data for polling districts. Democracy Club need people like me
* Home office forms on node.js? It may be time to move away from the idea of a forms engine
* Find out about json scrapers and how to use them. This unlocks the web
