It's felt like a really eventful 12 months since the last UKGovCamp (has it really been 12 months?) which has seen another change of jobs, some annoying health issues, some large life decisions being made and becoming the proud(?) owner of hearing aids.

And as if the Digital Gods were listening, it has been topped off with another visit to UK GovCamp, this year back in its long-time home at Petty France in the Ministry of Justice offices. It felt like coming home in many ways; seeing old 'family', lots of hugs, lots of smiles and LOTS of new arrivals - maybe a 50:50 split newbies:returners?

It's hard to explain the concept of UKGovCamp to my private sector work colleagues, the 'seeing old friends/meeting new friends' line was the easiest bet in describing it, but way undersells the whole thing and I honestly feel sorry for them never having experienced it.

## Pitching In
Returning home also meant a return to traditional session pitching, which I really missed last year. There was a noticeable shift in emphasis, with a number of pitches about AI. I welcomed this as my fear was the public sector has been adopting a 'head in sand' approach to it all, particular after the discussions at Product for the People this year. More on that later.....

Although this was a much more inclusive (and fun) way to hear what people wanted to talk about, I still struggled with hearing what was happening thanks to my hearing loss, but others without hearing issues also said that it was hard for them too. In the end I located myself about 2 metres from the pitchers just to make sure I could hear them. It felt like much of it was down to pitchers really not being sure how to use a microphone (despite the best efforts of the UKGovCamp organisers to guide them). Talking to [James](https://bsky.app/profile/jacattell.bsky.social) afterwards was great as he was acutely aware of the issue and was thinking about an induction loop for next year.

There was a much heralded potential pitch from GovCamp legend Amanda, but despite repeated provocation during the pitching session it, sadly, never came to pass.

## Session 1: Facilitating flexible workplaces for disabled people
I chose [this session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j7T3GdFiDdIirA7d_bBVOy_2twW4cBry4ga9q8VS8KU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.xaupab12k9xs) as I'm interested in how organisations adapt to the needs of individuals to get the most out of them. This was close to my heart having lived with a health condition since I was 18, which has sometimes been the focus of employers' attention on starting a new job. But the subject has really been thrown into sharp focus with the long-term impact of COVID-19.

One issue that got kicked around is how managers best support their staff. Is it better advice/guidance? Training? Or do they need an (un)healthy dose of trauma to best be able to empathise with their staff? And how do we prevent the promotion of inequality through the use of 'manager's discretion'? One manager discussing her actions to help her staff member felt exemplary, but what if her fellow managers fail to meet that standard. Tricky.

I loved the supportive and constructive discussion from the small group. It does feel like the civil service is leading the way in terms of workplace passports as a way to properly define and adapt to needs.

## Session 2: How can AI work for government & what is parliaments role in Government
There were many AI-themed sessions to choose from , and I didn't want to dominate my day with them, so took one that felt like it might have a positive spin rather than simply guarding against the dangers. It was a large group, so our facilitator did a great job in splitting out the session into its two component parts for discussion.

Part 1 started with us splitting into groups of 2 or 3 to discuss. Like others, our group got tangled up with defining what AI is. My take was that as soon as we have successfully defined it, it will have changed (a bit like the Dangerous Dogs legislation). A better metaphor that came out of the plenary session was it "was like two doctors saying 'medicine' ", which I quite liked. Another suggestion, which I have to admit I groaned at, was 'we need to start educating in schools early', only because after decades in local government I seemed to have heard that about most issues. But actually on reflection I thought this did have merit; we have taken computers into schools and made it part of educating children, so this could be a natural extension. A shame we don't extend that thinking to non-digital issues like how to work out newspapers print bile or how to budget. Anyway....

Part 2 was really about what government can do to regulate or minimise the risks of getting it wrong. Quite the hot topic and some strong views expressed. I had a bit an open mind about this, but had wondered about the practicalities and effectiveness of legislating cross-border given its international scope. But there were some persuasive arguments about legislative frameworks being needed for learning to drive and building nuclear power stations. When the latter was challenged as it applied to very few people/circumstances, the killer reply was 'I can't build a nuclear power station in my laptop'. Making individuals responsible felt like a great approach, akin to health and safety legislation (the possibility of corporate manslaughter charges certainly focused some CEO minds).

## Session 3: Public libraries under pressure, can you help?
I would admit I joined this session for two main reasons; Pauline Roche was running it, and I did a [Best Value Review of Libraries in Oxfordshire(https://docs.google.com/document/d/0B-FCpROzRlMvT09LemY4RElEZFE/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113572293247419263045&resourcekey=0-mUyH-rT3WBbU7oQ9UJBGTw&rtpof=true&sd=true) a long time back. Actually, the more I thought about that, the longer ago I realised it actually was (2001! All record gone on the OCC website, so I'm glad I kept my own copy)

Pauline set the scene with what is happening with Birmingham libraries and her work to save them. She invited each person in the group to go in turn and gives their experiences or thoughts. I was really struck by how much experience was in the room, and the really sensible ideas that came forward. Mine felt a bit outdated given how long it had been since my Review, but I did push back a bit on the idea of just stating the moral case for keeping them as this didn't actually provide the funding needed.

A really good, practical idea from one participant working for a not for profit trust running libraries elsewhere in the country was that taking the buildings out of business rates through having a trust own them instead did save money.

What I loved about this session was how passionate everyone in the room was about the topic, and how the session grew into one that was more celebratory and positive.

## Corridor Camp
I've often watched others in envy how they can effortlessly just fall into conversation for ages and miss sessions. I got close last year with my wonderful chat with Chloe and Jay from [Vouchsafe](https://vouchsafe.id/about-us/) but it didn't mean missing any sessions.

So I was more than delighted to find myself slipping into it almost by accident after a quick hello with [Louise](https://bsky.app/profile/pretendcato.bsky.social) which ended up being a really great conversation, and then being joined by [Juksie](https://bsky.app/profile/jukes.ie) for the next two sessions.

For anyone new to the Unconference concept, rid yourself of the idea that this is somehow squandering the time you have at the event. This IS the event. The possibility of chance encounters leading to deep conversations, creating better understanding and better relationships. It's an extension of [what I learned in 2017](https://www.ox1digital.co.uk/blog/2017/01/24/between-then-and-now?query=ukgovcamp) about just striking up a conversation with someone you don't know - that's how I can now hug [JeniT](https://bsky.app/profile/jenitennison.com) when I see her (my first victim), how I could have a great catch-up with [Sym](https://bsky.app/profile/symroe.bsky.social) about all things [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/) and how I know dozens of other people I got to catch up and chat with.

I couldn't begin to list everyone I loved seeing again, those I didn't get the chance to say Hi to, and those I'd hoped to see there, but hopefully I'll be back again next year.
