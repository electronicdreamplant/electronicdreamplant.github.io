description: Self hosting photos using GitHub Pages
---

This project was looking at alternatives to hosting photos rather than using products like Flickr or relying on Google Photos. These are all great, but at the time of putting this together Flickr had moved to a charging model.

It is based on a fork of the [GitHub Pages Gallery repo by guatamkrishnar](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/github-pages-gallery) which was pretty easy to set up. His instructions are pretty good so just following these got me a long way towards establishing it.

Overall though I found there were too many limitations to go wholesale on moving across to a self-hosted option:

*   If you are uploading original files then the sizes start to get pretty large, and GitHub limits the size of any one repo. Then you're in to linking repos together, which starts to make it complicated
*   The displays are functional but not really compelling. I'm not a fan of the thumbnail screen, and the presentation of each image doesn't showcase it sufficiently for mefor me
*   I would have my photos split across different products, which is more work to maintain
