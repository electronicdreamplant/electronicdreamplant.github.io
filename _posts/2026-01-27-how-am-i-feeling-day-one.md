The night had seemed endless. I don't remember at what point I gave up on the idea of sleep. The tightness in my chest had abated at least.

I remember being obsessed with money and waking to use my phone calculator to start working out how long we could live on what we had. I'm not sure what I thought I'd do with this information in the night that couldn't wait until morning.

I felt an encroaching panic, trying to sort all the feelings and options I had all at once. At some point I started crying and I hadn't expected that.

i think I realised then that trying to work today wasn't going to happen. I had been holding until Wednesday to get the demo done; I knew it was important and I know I'm good at them. It wasn't that I was panicking about.

As ever with any illness, the moment I realised I wasn't well was when I started thinking more rationally; someone else could handle the demo, or it could get postponed. I needed to see the GP that morning.

When we arrived at the surgery (I was driven there as lack of sleep meant I wasn't safe to drive) I couldn't form the words to tell the receptionist anything and just started crying again. She insisted on me taking some tissues, saying 'have some on the NHS'.

I think it was more than an hour until I saw Dr Griffiths. She was as kind and lovely as ever and so it wasn't long before I was in tears again.

I loved that she said taking the first step was the important thing and lots of help was available. I tried to explain why I was feeling like I was but it all sounded so feeble and childish; 'the nasty man was mean to me and my friends'

I remember her talking about medications and all I wanted was permission not to be at work. Even though I know I could self certify my in-built paranoia holds up a sign that says 'no one will believe you unless a doctor says it'.

When she did talk about time away from work it seemed too long and that scared me too. We agreed at the lowest she'd go of 2 weeks and then a review. I clutched that bit of paper and picked up the meds, caring less about the drugs that would help and more about my magic permission slip.

Then I just needed to let people know properly and I could craw into bed for the day. I sent my manager a message and almost instantly he called me. Even his own rotten run of health and a slipped disc didn't stop him reaching out. Obviously I dissolved into tears and sounded ridiculous. At some point I think I said I would have to evaluate if I could actually stay at work.

An email into work and I was done. And almost instantly I felt oddly calm. It reminded me of the time I rolled our car and emerged unscathed, being back at home and eating dinner within 30 mins like nothing had happened. It doesn't make sense to me.

My only way of describing this was it being like a large rock had been taken off my chest (think the end of Braveheart here), just leaving behind me. (More) normal me.

On reflection I'm not sure the reasons for the feelings I had are as important as their impact. What one person can withstand is completely different to someone else. I'm not a resilient person (HR people like to talk about resilience as if it's something you can create) and nor was my father, whose path it feels like I'm following in many ways.

I should have seen the warning signs (as others clearly had); being angry over the entire weekend and comfort eating. Ranting at at least three people on Monday morning about the nasty man. Feeling dazed and unable to make a decision by late afternoon that day.  

Dr Griffiths and I talked about mindfullness and local help groups. I will look into these, but I think for now writing my thoughts down is a good way of exploring things while I just get some rest
