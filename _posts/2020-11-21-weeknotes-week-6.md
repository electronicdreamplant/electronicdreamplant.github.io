Sometimes the title for my weeknotes comes easily, but more often it is pretty contrived. I thought of a few this week;

*   Do Webmasters Dream of WordPress Sheep? (there was a possible insomnia link but I hadn’t really done that much CMS work, and it’s a bit niche anyway)
*   Thatch-22 (A Dorset house move hat-tip to the conundrum of not being able to book removals until I have a move date, but I can’t get that date until we exchange contracts and we can’t exchange contracts without agreeing a date, but I can’t agree a date until I can book it with the removals company. Any anyway our new house isn’t thatched, so…)

Instead I decided that our Atlassian tool for every occasion merited a special mention since it featured heavily in the week just gone.

The first of these boards was to help gear up for the arrival of our new content designer, also from ‘up north’ (as we seem to be to native Dorseteers), [inspired by the GDS approach to onboarding using Trello](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/23/introduction-to-the-new-induction/) and from my own experiences of onboarding remotely during an ongoing crisis. Breaking up a long-ish Word document into bite-size nibbles simultaneously brought the content alive and (I hope) made it more digestible. I found lots of things I’d missed as an inductee in putting this together, so at the end of the week at a newbie welcoming event I shared it with senior managers outside of Digital to see if it would resonate.

In truth there were two induction boards, with the second focused at our content design team-level. The team were great in pitching in to help on this, including short bios on each of us to make up for the lack of face-to-face contact and trying to personalise the whole process. The other thing that stood out for me was how the existing managers induction checklist is heavily skewed to office location (desk, fire exits, toilets, kitchens etc) which now feels like a remnant of a world left behind.

The right-hand board reflects a sudden upswing in our house move status from ‘it will happen after Xmas’ to ‘we have just over two weeks’. However, with as chain as long as the one for the [Sandbanks Ferry](https://www.sandbanksferry.co.uk/gallery/) it’s anything but certain. A move to order broadband at our new house resulted in the current owners being notified their service was being terminated, followed by cancellation, apologies and not-so-quiet recriminations with our provider. We did at least manage to arrange our milk delivery. Yey….

## Team stuff

We’re into our second round of 1:1 meetings so have moved from a meet and greet to focusing on what we all need to achieve. Dorset have developed a great tool called My ROAD Map (I’ll spare you the acronym explanation) which staff played a big part in helping design. The result of this is an approach that, as a new manager, feels less like a process and more like a working relationship. I particularly like the My Achievements section that allows you to keep track of what you’ve done, uploading evidence and notes. It’s too easy to move on to the next thing when busy and forget the journey, so a record like this is right up my street.

After a long team meeting we also realised how much we’re valuing a regular get together as a smaller group; there are huge changes on the horizon, we’re exploring how to work differently and there’s still a remnant of discomfort over the unitary restructure. We’ve set up an extra quick-fire meeting to supplement this.

These meetings are also really productive. We agreed to prototype a hack to share work requests and balance workloads across the team, stepping away from siloed work allocations ahead of introducing a formal workflow approach change. By the end of the week this was taking shape and bearing some fruit I think, but as my favoured expression goes “if it doesn’t work we’ll do something else”. The enormity and scope of what the content designers do is beginning to land.

## Placecube Progress

Monday saw the first proper meeting focusing on our CMS switch. I’d been doing some prep for this to make sure we didn’t miss any angles. Alongside my Airtable creation, mapping the content types and components, I’d been talking to our (awesome) GIS team about location-based functionality. I’m still debating how we communicate the exact functionality we need and may move to creating good-old user stories in the end.

Scoping feels like it’s been brought down to a more manageable size, and after a week checking out some errant references to other domains on the CMS (“is this your website or ours?”) I think I have a measure of the beast. We’ve got a number of spin-out workshops planned to focus on the key issues to resolve them in the coming weeks.

And much like the house move suddenly things felt like they were moving quickly from a standing start. We’re expecting a spin-up of our environment (themed as well) next week, and the content design team will be the first to be trained the following week to really get our hands dirty and learn through doing.

## Other stuff in summary

Looking back on the week there is so much other stuff to report that could turn this weeknote into a novel. Another reason for this self reflection stuff is to make you stop and think that while it may feel that nothing has been achieved, actually the exact opposite is true.

So, to avoid missing anything, the week also involved:

*   [The Great Conscription Of Women Writing Weeknotes in Dorset](https://twitter.com/Ox1Digital/status/1327531708766445568) last weekend, which so far has only produced one internal weeknote (well done Claire. The rest of you know who you are…)
*   being schooled in the proper use of bullet points (how am I doing Claire?)
*   finding a colleague selling a rowing machine, which will help tackle my Lockdown Belly once we move
*   the first disagreement with my manager, which was odd, but we both noted it and got on with life like grownups
*   a service development session thinking about the actions, behaviours and skills needed for a design approach
*   being asked by a new colleague for my advice and striking up a lovely working partnership as a result
*   being approached by another colleague worried she’d upset me, and doing the same myself with another colleague. Text-based exchanges are the worst for interpreting intent and emotion
*   managing to condense everything we need to do on accessibility into a 3-sided report (a victory for brevity while still epic in its scope)
*   pushing the content design message to colleagues and arm-twisting to get an earlier seat at the table
*   attending a Dorset show and tell that didn’t happen and one that did and was awesome (well done Vicky et al)
*   a 30 minute session on a dodgy form request that turned into an epic meeting covering content design, user research and business needs for data -vs- user needs
*   ordering a batch of things from Amazon to help winch down all the boxes stored in my loft. It may even work
*   getting stupidly stressed about moving, being snappy with Mrs L and then realising that being lovely to each other is what actually gets us through things together
*   finally adding some user research to the [LocalGov Digital User Research Library](https://research.localgov.digital/?keywords=chatbot&phase=__None&document_type=__None&started_before=0&started_after=0&search=true) and telling colleagues about it
*   a LocalGov Digital Steering Group meeting where we decided to launch a set of podcasts in the New Year, and where Nick experimented with Zoom backgrounds with mixed results
