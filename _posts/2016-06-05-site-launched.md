After a number of false starts I've finally put out a website of my own. I've chosen to do it the hard way using hard coding and playing with CSS rather than go for a Wordpress site or other blogging platform.

This site uses GitHub Pages, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts, although that takes a bit of getting used to. The advantage here is that I can use Git to see the site structure and add what I need as I go. 

I suspect the design will evolve as I go.
