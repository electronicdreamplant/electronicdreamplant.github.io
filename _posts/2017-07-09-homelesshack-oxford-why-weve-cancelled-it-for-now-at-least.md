I’m cancelling the HomelessHack in Oxford scheduled for 28/29 July 2017 and wanted to explain the reasons to everyone.

## How it started

With Twitter ablaze with frantic chatter from the London and Manchester events on #homelesshack it looked like anything was possible. There was a real sense of a movement beginning, and it felt like everyone wanted to pitch in.

A chance mention by someone of homelessness being discussed at a meeting in Oxford led to me (naively) replying to suggest there should be a similar hack in Oxford. And then everything just took off. Suddenly I was organising it.

Being new to an event like this I threw myself into it as best I could, with dozens of tweets and emails aimed at people and organisations I know. My hope was we could follow the model used in Manchester of a tech firm ‘adopting’ the event by providing facilities, people and support on the costs.

I had some fantastic help from [Oxford Hackspace](https://oxhack.org) who got on board early in providing a venue, and giving advice on how to make the event work. So before long we had a date and the Eventbrite sign-up page went up.

## But then…

While there was lots of encouragement and remote help from other organisers, after a couple of weeks (and very few sign-ups) it was starting to feel like things weren’t working out as I’d hoped.

Others seemed to share my disappointment

I gave it a further week to see if a change in sign up numbers indicated that we could get a critical mass of interested people together in time. We had a small upswing but not enough.

After a few more sleepless nights and last-ditch pitches to people I decided that it wasn’t going to come off as I’d hoped. Better to cancel now and come back to it later.

## What went wrong

Talking to a few people it started to dawn on me that I’d made a number of mistakes in getting this running;

1.  **We picked the wrong date:** With my kids all grown up I hadn’t realised that the event coincided with the first weekend of the school holidays in Oxford. A fair number of people that wanted to be involved just couldn’t make it.
2.  **It came out of nowhere:** It feels like the events in London and Manchester emerged after a real groundswell of support built up before launching. We really just unleashed this without any notice on an unsuspecting Oxford, so it’s a bit unfair to expect everyone to drop everything and join in.
3.  **An “organising committee of one”**: This observation by one of my friends made me realise my key mistake — I was trying to do this alone. And with no experience in doing it before I was really out of my depth. An event like this needs a core of people that can divide up the work between them, and keep the energy going.
4.  **We never found our “White Knight”**: All the way through the organising I was still hoping that a local tech firm would swoop in and rescue us. But unfortunately it wasn’t to be. I guess I just don’t have the contacts to pull this sort of thing off, and despite grants being available from UKGovCamp the venue costs and catering costs were mounting up. I have to admit to being a bit personally disappointed by this, as Oxford is a recognised [TechCity Cluster](http://technation.techcityuk.com/cluster/oxford/) with the right sort of companies and agencies to adopt an event like this.

## What next?

As the HomelessHack movement isn’t organised by one individual or body, it’s really for Oxford to decide what it wants to do next. Perhaps it needs a bit more time to get on board with the idea, or word needs to spread a little more to make it take off. Perhaps there is someone working for that White Knight company that wants to flex its corporate social responsibility muscles and pitch in. 

I hope it does, as I’d love to be part of something that made a difference in the City I live in.
