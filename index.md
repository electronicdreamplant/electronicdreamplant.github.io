## Current role

I'm a Product Manager for [Unilink](https://www.unilink.com/), helping to develop communications products for offenders that allow them to stay in touch with family and friends.

Prior to that I was a Product Owner for Placecube, and held a variety of digital, improvement and project roles in local government.

## Work projects

* I was Product Owner for the Phase 2 of the [DLUHC-funded Low Code Digital Waste Services project](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/funded-project/digital-waste-service/), which developed a reminders capability, a business account, a one-click deployment trading platform and a microsite design template
* I led on the migration of Dorset Council's website from Contentis to Liferay using automated tools. You can [view a video about the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxywW-91wGI)
* I led a [national discovery project into the use of chatbots and artificial intelligence](https://localdigitalchatbots.github.io/about/), securing an £80,000 grant from MHCLG and working collaboratively with 12 other councils. It was evaluated as a ‘good model for other local authorities planning to undertake a collaborative project'
* I led on an in-house development of an intranet for Oxford City Council in Drupal. The project team I managed was awarded Team of the Year award at Oxford City Council staff awards in 2015
* I led on the redevelopment of [Oxford City Council's website](https://www.oxford.gov.uk) in 2016 which saw satisfaction improve to be consistently in the top five nationally (as measured through GovMetric benchmarking) and a move of 26.3% of online transactions in 2015/16 to 43.2% in 2019/20 through digital service improvements
* I project managed the redevelopment of a derelict council building into a [new Health Centre for Banbury](https://photos.app.goo.gl/um1jrWaxGgov27ks5)
* I undertook a Best Value Review of Library Services in Oxfordshire which was identified as one of 10 nationally that had led to “significant change”
* I played a key role in the development of Oxfordshire County Council’s [CPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Performance_Assessment) improvement strategy. This includes writing the Council’s corporate improvement plan, devising a strategy to take the Council from a ‘fair’ CPA assessment in 2002 to an ‘excellent’ assessment in 2005

## Other info
I first cut my teeth on web projects in the early 90's when I decided I'd set up a website for the motor racing club that I was involved with. All frames and static html pages with a bit of javascript borrowed from other sites

I'm a keen member of [LocalGov Digital](https://localgov.digital), a community of local government digital practitioners, and was on its Steering Group for a number of years
