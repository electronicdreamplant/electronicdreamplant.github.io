  <h2>Using GitHub Pages</h2>
  <p>I wanted to have a workspace I could play with while getting better at using Git, and found out (by accident really) that GitHub can also be used to host webpages via <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. This felt like a perfect solution</p>
  <p>To be started I followed this <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">excellent guide</a> by Johnathan McGlone to understand the basics. He's good on explaining the way Jekyll works, particularly for the blog part.</p>
  <p>To assign my domain name I followed the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/">GitHub help pages</a>, which get you most of the distance.</p>
  <p>More recently I've found <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained/">this guide</a> by RedWrite which has persuaded me to try out the GitHub Desktop to do things properly</p>
