  <h2><a href="index.html">Projects/</a>Using GitHub Pages and Git</h2>

  <p>I wanted to have a workspace I could play with while getting better at using Git, and found out (by accident really) that GitHub can also be used to host webpages via <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. This felt like a perfect solution.</p>

  <p>To get started I followed this <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">excellent guide</a> by Johnathan McGlone to understand the basics. He's good on explaining the way Jekyll works, particularly for the blog part. He also covers some aspects of Markdown, but other references are probably needed for this to get the full picture.</p>

  <p>To assign my domain name I followed the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/">GitHub help pages</a>, which get you most of the distance.</p>

  <p>More recently I've found <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained/">this guide</a> by RedWrite which has persuaded me to try out the GitHub Desktop and do things properly. Having installed this I've created a local repo for this site on my laptop, and am using it in combination with Sublime to do the coding. This also means I can work offline and commit changes as I go.</p>
