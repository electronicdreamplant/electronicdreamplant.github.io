  <h2>Creating an Open Data Portal</h2>

  <p>Part of our forthcoming Digital Strategy is to move towards making more of our data open for others to see and use.</p>
  
  <p>Fortuitously, our partners were also having the same idea, so this project moved quickly from 'how do we get this off the ground' to 'let's work together!'</p>
