  <h1>Ron's 101st birthday</h1>
 </div>
 
As it had been a bit of a struggle with Ron getting in and out of the car for Xmas, Rachel hit upon the idea of taking a meal to him as part of his birthday instead. We set this up with the home and they arranged to have the quiet room on the floor booked for us for the lunchtime. I have to admit I didn't even know there was a quiet room!

We got there at just before in and sneaked in to start setting things up. The care team had put a 'Happy birthday' banner on the door to keep people out, and put up a table and some chairs for us. They'd even supplied a tablecloth (we'd brought one just in case).

We'd brought some decorations with us, purchased via Amazon, and tried to make the room a little more festive
