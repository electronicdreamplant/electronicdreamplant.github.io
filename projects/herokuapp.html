  <h2><a href="index.html">Projects/</a>Live Analytics Dashboard</h2>

  <p>This project was kick-started by a LocalGovDigital Slack discussion, with Ben Cheetham trying to set up a display screen for his workplace.</p>
  </p>
  <p>Ben had come across <a href="https://github.com/openplans/city-analytics-dashboard">a fork</a> of a dashboard built for the Government Digital Service by Ed Sowden. The original project is <a href="https://github.com/edds/display-screen">here.</a></p>
  
  <p>The nice part was this had been set up to run on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> so there's no mucking around with servers to get it running.</p>  
  
  <p>The fork came with some <a href="http://dfd-dashboard-setup.herokuapp.com/">nice instructions</a> but these proved too tricky for me to get my head around completely. Luckily my daughter had managed to land herself a handy webdev who was able to show me the way with some <a href="../uploads/How_do_you_Heroku.pdf">really good instructions.</a></p>
  
  <p>I've run this on a large screen at work, which is particulary effective. The best occasion was during local elections, when we could see exactly how the event affected website traffic, and how much more traffic we were getting!</p>
  
  <p>It's also really useful to check on what people are searching for at particular times of the day, or getting a sense of when mobile use overtakes desktop use.</p>
