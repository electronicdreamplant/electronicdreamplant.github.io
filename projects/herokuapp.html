  <p>This project was kick-started by a LocalGovDigital Slack discussion, with Ben Cheetham trying to set up a display screen for his workplace.</p>
  </p>
  <p>Ben had come across <a href="https://github.com/openplans/city-analytics-dashboard">a fork</a> of a dashboard built for the Government Digital Service by Ed Sowden. The original project is <a href="https://github.com/edds/display-screen">here.</a></p>

  <p>The nice part was this had been set up to run on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> so there's no mucking around with servers to get it running.</p>

  <p>The fork came with some <a href="http://dfd-dashboard-setup.herokuapp.com/">nice instructions</a> but these proved too tricky for me to get my head around completely. Luckily my daughter had managed to land herself a handy webdev who was able to show me the way with some <a href="../uploads/How_do_you_Heroku.pdf">really good instructions.</a></p>

  <p>I've run this on a large screen at work, which is particularly effective. The best occasion was during local elections, when we could see exactly how the event affected website traffic, and how much more traffic we were getting! I could only find a photo of an early version, still using the default black background of the original fork (below)</p>

  <p>It's also really useful to check on what people are searching for at particular times of the day, or getting a sense of when mobile use overtakes desktop use.</p>

  <p>It was great to see Citizens Advice going down this road with their <a href="http://cab-labs-dashboard.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com">Dashboard</a> which is more in line with how GDS set theirs up.</p>

  <p>For a really good guide to doing this from scratch and seeing some very attractive versions in use in the USA check out the <a href="https://github.com/18F/analytics.usa.gov">analytics.usa.gov project </a>. I like the way these are set out which  means I'll have to revisit my project to get it up to their standard!</p>
