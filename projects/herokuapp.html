  <h2><a href="index.html">Projects/</a>Live Analytics Dashboard</h2>

  <p>This project was kick-started by a LocalGovDigital Slack discussion, with Ben Cheetham trying to set up a display screen for his workplace.</p>
  </p>
  <p>Ben had come across <a href="https://github.com/openplans/city-analytics-dashboard">a fork</a> of a dashboard built for the Government Digital Service by Ed Sowden. The original project is <a href="https://github.com/edds/display-screen">here.</a></p>
  
  <p>The nice part was this had been set up to run on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> so there's no mucking around with servers to get it running</p>  
  
  <p>The fork came with some <a href="http://dfd-dashboard-setup.herokuapp.com/">nice instructions</a> but these proved too tricky for me to get my head around completely. Luckily my daughter had managed to land herself a handy webdev who was able to show me the way with some <a href="../uploads/how_do_you_Heroku.pdf">really good instructions.</a></p>
