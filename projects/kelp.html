  <h2><a href="index.html">Projects/</a>Kelp - a LocalGovMakers Project</h2>

  <p>Other than being a type of seaweed, what on earth is Kelp?. Read on for an explanation...</p>
  
  <p>At my first LocalGovCamp in June 2016 I was involved in a bit of the set-up, which means I was in Birmingham the night before with the organisers. During a really nice meal out one of them mentioned that they'd been speaking to a really great company, which happened to be one I had had lots of problems with lately.</p>
  
  <p>We both realised that what was lacking in the local government world was a way of us keeping tabs on companies or their products in a way that could alert us to issues, and perhaps persuade them to up their game.</p>
  
  <p>As this was just conversation over a drink I though no more about it until we were looking at projects for the Makers Day the next morning. As everyone threw in ideas for a project, the idea of a way of rating and commenting on companies and projects came out, and was duly written down on a post-it and forgotten for an hour. The name "Kelp" comes from Lucy Knight's shorthand description of it being like "Yelp for Capita", (Capita + Yelp = Kelp) which is is a bit cheesy but catchy too.</p>
  
  <p>The more it was talked about, the more it felt like an idea with legs. So four of us (myself, Lucy Knight, Sym Roe and Dominic Jones) worked on it some more. It has to be said here that the work fell into three parts; Sym doing all the coding, Lucy and Dominic doing all the thinking on design, and me taking photos of them!</p>

  <p>The base of Kelp comes from screen scraping the Digital Marketplace API to provide all the company names.</p>

  <p>As it was Makers Day, we spent a good deal of time focusing on the user interface. What was it going to look like when people first used it? How could we persuade them to add more information? We took some inspiration from sites that gave a gentle 'nag' when you logged on, like LinkdIn for completing your profile.</p>
