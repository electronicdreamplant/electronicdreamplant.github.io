  <h1><a href="index.html">Projects </a><small>Creating a free open data platform</small></h1>
 </div>

p>I decided to post about this project as I recently came across some old files while clearing my laptop. Also, I'm amazed to see <a href="https://www.oxopendata.uk/">the site is still running</a> with its domain name intact.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Back when I was Digital Development Manager at Oxford City Council I had a broad (unfocused?) remit to 'do' digital things, one of which was looking into how we could further aspirations to publish open data.</p>
<p>Some of the requirements to do this were enshrined in law (mostly environmental data) but the Economic Development team were really keen to do something as it could support business. It actually got built into the <a href="https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/strategy/collaboration.html">Digital Strategy</a> of the time.</p>
<p>The council was working alongside Oxfordshire County Council to move this along, and some funding had been found to use a platform by <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, which was at a cost of &pound;10k per annum (apparently a significantly reduced premium). But this couldn't be sustained, so a low cost alternative was needed.</p>
<h3>Exploring the options</h3>
<p>With no funding in sight I looked at obvious candidates like <a href="https://www.data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> for just hosting datasets, but felt this wouldn't encourage non-traditional users to get involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://ckan.org/">CKAN</a> was the technology running data.gov.uk, and being open source felt like a contender. But the technical know-how required to get it up and running were beyond me.</p>
<p>There were a few lower-cost platforms, and <a href="https://www.devon.gov.uk/factsandfigures/open-data/">Devon County Council had done some great work just using Wordpress</a> and some Python.</p>
<p>Then I came across a Jekyll-based CKAN alternative that was designed to work on GitHub Pages</p>
<h3>Using JKAN</h3>
<p><a href="https://jkan.io/">JKAN</a> is a project by <a href="https://twitter.com/timwis">Tim Wisniewski</a>, back then the Chief Data Officer at the City of Philadelphia (but now heading the tech side at Citizen's Advice here in the UK).</p>
<p>As he puts it on the JKAN site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open-source data portals can be really hard to install and maintain. But their basic purpose of providing links to download data really isn&rsquo;t that complicated. JKAN is a proof-of-concept that allows a small, resource-strapped government agency to stand-up an open data portal by simply clicking the fork button.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The instructions were easy to follow, and options to style the site were simple to grasp.&nbsp;</p>
