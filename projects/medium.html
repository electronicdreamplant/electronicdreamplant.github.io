  <h1><a href="index.html">Projects </a><small>Adding a Medium feed to the site</small></h1>
 </div>

<p>I had started a blog on this site as Jekyll works well organising them on a static pages site, but found I wasn't really writing anything here. I've used Medium far more for writing actual blog posts, so wanted to bring that content in to this site rather than just link to it.</p>

<p>Medium <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-Using-RSS-feeds-of-profiles-publications-and-topics">publishes an RSS feed</a> to syndicate content, but I needed a way to actually publish this on the site.</p>

<p>There were a few ways I found online to do it, but the first step was getting the RSS feed converted into json by using <a href="www.rss2json.com">rss2json.com</a> which is a free service.</p>

<p>After that I was a bit stuck as most of the advice I found was way too technical for me. Finally I found <a href="https://github.com/GiacintoCarlucci/medium-on-website">Giacinto Carlucci's excellent Medium on website repo</a> providing just what I needed - a nice set of instructions and all the code set out for me</p>

<p>Giacinto's code provides the javascript along with css, both of which have options for how you want the blogroll to appear on your site. The js has four template options (classic, mini, compact and custom - the last being a 'do your own thing' approach) and the css has three themes (light, dark and 'batman'!)</p>

<p>The API provided by the rss2json site slots nicely into the API_URL constant in the js, and then you are good to go! I changed the template a bit to add my own button at the foot of each card, and used some of the site colours in the css file.</p>

<h3>Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Medium RSS feed only provides for 10 posts at a time. Actually, this is probably no bad thing. I just tacked on a link at the foot of the index page</li>
<li>If I used an image from another source (like a youtube video) this displays an odd URL within the body of the card summary. I've not been able to resolve that one</li>
