<button class="accordion">About homelessness in Oxford</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Homelessness in Oxford takes many forms: from the visible rough sleepers on our streets, to the invisible families that have fallen on hard times. People who experience homelessness are often affected by a wide range of issues, including relationship breakup, domestic violence, debt, mental health issues, drug and alcohol issues, and changes to benefits.</p>

<p>Over recent years the Government has cut its £9m annual grant to Oxford City Council to nothing. Despite this challenging financial situation, the City Council is doing its best to support everyone who is at risk of or becomes homeless.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Help for homeless families</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>In 2015, Oxford City Council partnered with Resonance Real Lettings property fund, with both organisations contributing £5m to purchase houses in or near Oxford for local families that would otherwise be homeless. The partnership includes homelessness charity St Mungo’s Broadway, which manages the properties, provides support services and arranges moves on to sustainable accommodation. In 2016, the City Council contributed a further £10m for temporary accommodation purchase, and, in the draft budget for 2018/19, the City Council is proposing to commit a further £5m.</p>

<p>As part of this programme, the City Council is using compulsory purchase powers to buy empty Oxford homes for otherwise homeless Oxford families. The City Council is currently compulsorily purchasing a property in Rose Hill, which has stood empty since 1989, for this purpose.</p>

<p>However, the City Council’s work to prevent Oxford families from becoming homeless goes far beyond just buying houses, and includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A £50,000 emergency fund to help new Universal Credit claimants. New claimants have to wait at least six weeks before they get their first full payment of Universal Credit (changing to five weeks in February 2018); the fund aims to help with their utilities, food and essential living costs during that wait</li>
	<li>Supporting households affected by the benefit cap, bedroom tax and other cuts to their housing benefit with discretionary housing payments (DHPs). In 2017/18, we have a £509,495 DHP grant from the Department for Work and Pensions, which we use to top up rent shortfalls while customers work with our Welfare Reform Team to improve their financial circumstances and sustain their tenancies</li>
	<li>A pilot Rent Guarantee Scheme, helping families threatened with homelessness into private tenancies by offering guaranteed rent and tenancy management support to landlords while we work with their tenants to improve their financial situation</li>
	<li>As part of the City Council’s £1.4m annual grants programme, giving £518,379 in 2016/17 to organisations that provide advice and money-management support, including £200,000 to Oxford Citizens Advice Bureau, £85,290 to the Agnes Smith Advice Centre, and £122,611 to Oxford Community Work Agency</li>
	<li>As part of the same annual grants programme, in 2016/17 giving £35,082 to A2 Dominion to support those experiencing domestic abuse, £15,000 to Oxford Sexual Abuse & Rape Crisis Centre, and £1,000 to Reducing the Risk of Domestic Abuse</li>
	<li>Retaining more than 7,800 council houses to provide affordable homes to Oxford families, and building and purchasing hundreds of new council houses across Oxford, including 354 as part of the Barton Park housing development</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2004, the number of otherwise homeless Oxford families in temporary accommodation (i.e. hotels or B&Bs) stood at 1,000. But, thanks to all this work, the number in August 2017 was just 87 – down from 96 in March 2017. This stands in sharp contrast to the national trend, which has seen a 60% increase in the number of households in temporary accommodation since March 2011.</p>

<p>In 2016/17, Oxford City Council and its partners prevented 1,107 households from becoming homeless. And the City Council has now almost abandoned the use of hotels and B&Bs to house otherwise homeless Oxford families. Of the 96 households in temporary accommodation in March 2017, none were in hotels or B&Bs.</p>

<p>But the pressure on families in Oxford is increasing. More than 100 households every month are now approaching the City Council as homeless and requesting assistance.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Rough sleepers</button>
<div class="panel">


<p>Beds and services for rough sleepers in Oxford used to be largely funded through £1.4m of grants from Oxford City Council and £2m of grants from Oxfordshire County Council. Regrettably, due to a huge reduction in the amount of money it receives from central Government, Oxfordshire County Council has decided, from April 2018, to reduce its funding of homelessness services to zero.</p>

<p>At the same time, the number of people sleeping rough in Oxford is increasing. The official street count, which is carried out by every district in the country, revealed that 61 people were sleeping rough in Oxford – a dramatic increase from the 33 in 2016. But the City Council and homeless organisations estimate the number could be as many as 89 people – up from 47 in 2016.</p>

<p>We fund&nbsp;and provide&nbsp;a wide range of support services and accommodation for Oxford’s rough sleepers. The focus over the last year has been to mitigate the impact of Oxfordshire County Council’s funding cuts. But it is important to note that we do&nbsp;not have a statutory duty to provide this funding or these services. However, we see it as our humanitarian responsibility to help.</p>

<h3>More beds and a new shelter</h3>

<p>Simon House, a hostel in Oxford that helps rough sleepers with complex needs, was due to close in March 2018 as a direct result of Oxfordshire County Council’s funding cuts. However, we have provided the hostel with £200,000 of funding to keep 22 of the beds open until April 2019 to allow time for a new facility to be built at another location in the City.</p>

<p>We&nbsp;have&nbsp;provided £1.1m to enable A2Dominion, the leaseholder and support provider at Simon House, to build bespoke supported accommodation next to the John Allen Centre in Cowley. The new facility will provide 22 units of complex needs accommodation with staff on-site 24 hours a day, with a further 15 units of move-on accommodation for people with low support needs as they move towards independent living. Work is due to start on the new facility in the spring of 2018, subject to planning approval.</p>

<p>We have&nbsp;also provided an additional £160,000 to Response Housing and Oxford Homeless Pathways. This money will be used to double the number of beds at the Acacia housing project from five to 10 in the next two years. The Acacia project, which is based on the US Housing First model, has proved successful at resettling people whose multiple and complex needs make it difficult for them to manage in other types of supported housing.</p>

<h3>Grants to homelessness organisations</h3>

<p>Every year we provide&nbsp;£1.4m of grants to Oxford’s homelessness organisations to fund a wide range of support services. Much of these support services are targeted at early intervention to stop people from becoming homeless.</p>

<p>Funding targeted at helping existing rough sleepers aims to support them through what is known as the homeless pathway. This is the path from sleeping on the streets; through hostels and supported accommodation; with support services to help with employment, training, or any substance abuse or mental health issues; and finally to helping people into permanent accommodation and work.</p>

<p>In 2016/17 the grants funded the following organisations:</p>

<p>In our&nbsp;draft budget, we have&nbsp;proposed increasing the £1.4m of annual grants to homelessness organisations by £200,000 every year from 2019/20.</p>

<h3>Trailblazer funding</h3>

<p>In December 2016, we, along with Oxfordshire’s district councils, won £790,000 of Government funding (known as the Oxfordshire Trailblazer bid) to help vulnerable single adults under the age of 35, and households, at risk of homelessness.</p>

<p>For each at-risk individual, the money is being used to understand what services they need and what works best for them to stop them from becoming homeless. The work is focussing on three areas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Targeted prevention and outreach work: Officers from across the city and district councils actively seeking out those who may be at risk, and working with them to understand what could cause them to become homeless</li>
	<li>Resilience Services: Providing a range of services, including financial and employment advice and mentoring, to encourage behavioural change</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Homeless Champions Network: Homeless champions to work with key services, including health services and criminal justice, to assess individuals and help plan their discharge</li>
</ul>

<p>The joint bid, led by Oxford City Council, was to the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) £50m programme to prevent homelessness. The funding will be split over 2017/18 and 2018/19 (£395,000 each year).</p>

<h3>Church support this winter</h3>

<p>Churches across Oxford will be opening their doors during January, February and March 2018 to provide emergency accommodation for the city’s rough sleepers.</p>

<p>The seven churches – St Aldate’s, St Alban’s, St Clement’s, St Columba’s, St Ebbe’s, St Michael and the Northgate and Wesley Memorial – will each open their doors on a different night of the week.</p>

<p>The scheme will provide up to 10 beds for Oxford’s rough sleepers on a first come, first serve basis.</p>

<p>For more information and to donate to the project, please visit: <a href="http://oxfordanglican.co.uk/oxford-churches-team-up-to-offer-emergency-night-shelter/">http://oxfordanglican.co.uk/oxford-churches-team-up-to-offer-emergency-night-shelter/</a>.</p>

<h3>Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP)</h3>

<p>We fund the Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP), which provides emergency accommodation to everyone who needs it when the temperature is forecast to fall to 0°C or below for three consecutive nights. Oxford City Council is by far the largest provider of SWEP provision in Oxfordshire. There is no legal requirement to operate the SWEP but the City Council believes that it has a humanitarian responsibility in the face of the scale of rough sleeping in the city.</p>

<p>Although funded by the City Council, the SWEP is operated by experienced, professional staff at St Mungo’s Outreach, the Porch, O’Hanlon House and Simon House. Whenever SWEP opens these employees step up from their core duties to carry out the extra hours of work required.</p>

<p>We increased SWEP services this year by opening for seven nights over the Christmas and New Year period, and no one was turned away because of a lack of space. On some nights as few as five people used the service. With the current level of SWEP provision and the City Council's agreement with&nbsp; churches in Oxford to open 10 new beds every night between January and March as part of their Oxford Winter Night Shelter (OWNS) initiative, we believe that there is enough support to help all those rough sleepers who wish to get off the streets and access accommodation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>City Conversation</h3>

<p>In November 2017, more than 100 stakeholders came together to discuss rough sleeping and homelessness in Oxford. The City Conversation, organised by Oxford City Council, included representatives from Oxfordshire’s homelessness organisations; health and mental health providers; faith groups; councils, the police and other public bodies; local councillors; and people with actual experience of rough sleeping.</p>

<p>The aim of the City Conversation, which was the largest conversation of its kind to take place in Oxford, was to start to find a common understanding of what causes rough sleeping and street homelessness in Oxford, and to find the means to tackle the issue collectively.</p>

<p>The first conversation saw a number of core principles and possible objectives going forward agreed between the 100 delegates. Going forwards, the stakeholders will work towards agreeing a Rough Sleeping Charter for Oxford by April 2018, which will provide guiding principles for all concerned to help address the issue.</p>
