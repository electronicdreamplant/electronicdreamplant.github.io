<p>I'm Digital Development Manager for <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk">Oxford City Council</a>. I don't have real hands-on experience in writing code, but I'm trying to learn so that I can work more effectively with developers we employ.</p>

<p>I'm not an IT person by background.You can read my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-lawrence-3ba71a12">LinkedIn profile</a> if you want to see what I've done in past lives.</p>.

<p>I'm keen on photography. You can view my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neillawrencephotography">Flickr site</a> if you're interested and seeing the results.</p>
