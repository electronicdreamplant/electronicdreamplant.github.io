  <h1>About Me </a></h1>

<p><img src="../img/about.png" alt="arty photo of me" class="profile-photo"><p>
<p>I'm a Product Owner for <a href="https://www.placecube.com/about-placecube/">Placecube</a> helping to develop products for governments, businesses and the communities they serve. Prior to that I worked for a variety of local authorities at every structural level (parish council through to unitary council). You can read my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-lawrence-digital/">LinkedIn profile</a> to see what I've done in past lives.</p>

<p>A few of the projects I've worked on:<p>
<ul>
  <li>I was Product Owner for the Phase 2 of the <a href="https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/funded-project/digital-waste-service/">DLUHC-funded Low Code Digital Waste Services project</a>, which developed a reminders capability, a business account, a one-click deployment trading platform and a microsite design template</li>
  <li>I led on the migration of Dorset Council's website from Contentis to Liferay using automated tools. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxywW-91wGI">view a video about the project</a></li>
   <li>I led a <a href="https://localdigitalchatbots.github.io/about/">national discovery project into the use of chatbots and artificial intelligence</a>, securing an £80,000 grant from MHCLG and working collaboratively with 12 other councils. It was evaluated as a ‘good model for other local authorities planning to undertake a collaborative project'</li>
  <li>I led on an in-house development of an intranet for Oxford City Council in Drupal. The project team I managed was awarded Team of the Year award at Oxford City Council staff awards in 2015</li>
  <li>I led on the redevelopment of <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk">Oxford City Council's website</a> in 2016 which saw satisfaction improve to be consistently in the top five nationally (as measured through GovMetric benchmarking) and a move of 26.3% of online transactions in 2015/16 to 43.2% in 2019/20 through digital service improvements</li>
  <li>I project managed the redevelopment of a derelict council building into a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/um1jrWaxGgov27ks5">new Health Centre for Banbury</a></li>
  <li>I undertook a Best Value Review of Library Services in Oxfordshire which was identified as one of 10 nationally that had led to “significant change”</li>
  <li>I played a key role in the development of Oxfordshire County Council’s CPA improvement strategy. This includes writing the Council’s corporate improvement plan, devising a strategy to take the Council from a ‘fair’ CPA assessment in 2002 to an ‘excellent’ assessment in 2005</li>
</ul>

<p>I first cut my teeth on web projects in the early 90's when I decided I'd set up a website for the motor racing club that I was involved with. All frames and static html pages with a bit of javascript borrowed from other sites.</p>

<p>I'm a keen member of <a href="https://localgov.digital/">LocalGov Digital</a>, a community of local government digital practitioners, and was on its Steering Group for a number of years</p>
