<p>I'm Product Owner for <a href="https://www.placecube.com/about-placecube/">Placecube</a>, having worked for a variety of local authorities prior to that .You can read my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-lawrence-3ba71a12">LinkedIn profile</a> if you want to see what I've done in past lives.</p>

A few of the things I've done:

<ul>
<li>I led a <a href="https://localdigitalchatbots.github.io/about/">national discovery project into the use of chatbots and artificial intelligence</a>, securing an £80,000 grant from MHCLG and working collaboratively with 12 other councils. It was evaluated as a ‘good model for other local authorities planning to undertake a collaborative project'</li>
<li>The Intranet project team I managed was awarded Team of the Year award at Oxford City Council in 2015</li>
<li>The redevelopment of <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk">Oxford City Council's website</a> saw satisfaction improve to be consistently in the top five nationally (as measured through GovMetric benchmarking) and a move of 26.3% of online transactions in 2015/16 to 43.2% in 2019/20 through digital service improvements</li>
<li>I project managed the redevelopment of a derelict council building into a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/um1jrWaxGgov27ks5">new Health Centre for Banbury<a></li>
<li>I undertook a Best Value Review of Library Services in Oxfordshire which was identified as one of 10 nationally that had led to “significant change”</li>
<li>I played a key role in the development of Oxfordshire County Council’s CPA improvement strategy. This includes writing the Council’s corporate improvement plan, devising a strategy to take the Council from a ‘fair’ CPA assessment in 2002 to an ‘excellent’ assessment in 2005</li>
</ul>

<p>I first cut my teeth on web projects in the early 90's when I decided I'd set up a website for the motor racing club that I was involved with. All frames and static html pages with a bit of javascript borrowed from other sites.</p>

<p>I'm keen on photography. You can view my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/neillawrencephotography">Flickr site</a> if you're interested in seeing the kind of stuff I like to take.</p>
