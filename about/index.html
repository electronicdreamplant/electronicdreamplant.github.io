<h2>About</h2>
<src="selfie.png" alt="arty photo of me" class="profile-photo">
<p>I'm Digital Development Manager for <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk">Oxford City Council</a>. The irony is that I don't have real hands-on experience in writing code, so I'm trying to learn. That may all sound quite easy to some, but I've left it a bit late in life to get into all this.</p>

<p>You can read my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-lawrence-3ba71a12">LinkedIn profile</a> if you want to see what I've done in past lives.</p>.
