description: Using Github to host websites with Jekyll for layout
---

I wanted to have a workspace I could play with while getting better at using Git, and found out (by accident really) that GitHub can also be used to host webpages via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). This felt like a perfect solution.

To get started I followed this [excellent guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Johnathan McGlone to understand the basics. He's good on explaining the way Jekyll works, particularly for the blog part. He also covers some aspects of Markdown, but other references are probably needed for this to get the full picture.

To assign my domain name I followed the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/), which get you most of the distance.

More recently I've found [this guide](http://readwrite.com/2013/11/27/github-pages-explained/) by RedWrite which has persuaded me to try out the GitHub Desktop and do things properly. Having installed this I've created a local repo for this site on my laptop, and am using it in combination with Sublime to do the coding. This also means I can work offline and commit changes as I go.

### More recently

I've now set up three other accounts running GitHub Pages to enable me to get round a few temporary issues at work;

*   A means to temporarily host a old website after its hosting contract had expired but before we were able to complete it's redesign and new hosting. This just used the static HTML pages, PDFs and images
*   A 'front end' for an open data website when we realised that the platform used wouldn't allow us to edit or create pages as we wanted (or at least without a charge). All the styling has been copied across to make the transition between the platform and our front end as seamless as possible.
*   A site themed to look like our main website to host our digital strategy and digital design standards, together with a blog for my team.
