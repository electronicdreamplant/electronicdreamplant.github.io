As we've been so deep into our planning for a move to France for so many months, and have had so many long conversations with close friends and family about it, it felt like taking a step back and writing a simple summary would help us ensure it all made sense.

## Our objectives 
* to retire early and enjoy life together while we are still fit and healthy
* to be in the heart of Europe to live, learn and travel
* to stay in France as long as we can, or would like, rather than see it as a unchangeable decision 

## Why France?
* we love being there and have spent much time there together already
* 'joie de vie' - a country based on the concept of enjoying things that make life better
* a secular nation
* a proud history with a strong culture 
* born of revolution and has three firm principles; Liberty, Equality, Fraternity 
* itâ€™s many countries in one, each with their own regional identity and culture
* great food and drink (cheese!)

## Timing
We'll plan to retire in September 2026, but not necessariy make the move immediately. It makes more sense to adjust to not working and a fixed income and not make two large changes at the same time.

We will time the sale of our house for when the market is best (Spring/Summer)

## Accommodation
### UK
We realised some time ago that Dorset could never be our permanent home, so retaining our house long-term doesn't make sense as we would not want to return to it should we move back. 

It would be possible to rent out the house to provide additional income, but that would tie up the capital for longer and give us a set of responsibilities as a landlord we don't want.

We will sell the house after we have established ourselves in France but before we purchase a house there

### France
We will aim to move to the Alsace region, with a preference for Colmar (if possible). We will rent at first until we are sure of both the location and the country, and then look to purchase 

## Finances
### Income
As ex-local government workers we have defined benefits pensions that would be taxed in the UK only. This gives us a solid income base that isn't time-limited like other pensions.

We wil convert our two private pensions to annuities for further income. As mine is far smaller, I will take a six-year annuity to plug the income gap before my state pension kicks in. 

We estimate we can still add to our savings in retirement after meeting our day-to-day expenses.

### Savings
By the time we retire we will have built up a good capital base that will cover us post-work, and wil be able to add to this on a monthly basis. 

We will leave the bulk of our savings in UK ISAs as these provide a far better return than we can get on French investments. We will only draw down from these whe we need to, as they cannot be replenished once we are French tax residents.

We wil invest the capital from our house sale to help offset rental costs until we are ready to purchase.
